## Current Notable Issues

### VPN Client Internet Access / Routing
Remote VPN clients were able to reach LAN resources, but internet access behavior required additional routing/firewall work. This remains an important reference point for future VPN cleanup and the eventual move to WireGuard.

**Status:** In progress

### NAS Power-Loss Boot Behavior
The NAS has shown unreliable recovery behavior after power loss and may require full power drain/manual intervention before booting normally again.

**Status:** Open

### Preboot / Dropbear Remote Unlock Networking
The main server can stall during remote unlock in initramfs, and preboot networking has not always been reliably reachable.

**Status:** Open

## Why This Page Exists

This page is meant to capture:
- what happened
- what was learned
- what still needs to be fixed

Over time, major incidents should be broken out into their own dedicated writeups under `docs/`.
