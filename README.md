# Homelab Documentation

This repository documents my homelab architecture, services, troubleshooting, and operational notes. The lab is focused on practical networking, self-hosting, Linux administration, and reliability.

## Topology

## Environment Summary

Current environment includes:
- OPNsense router/firewall
- Main server: `seranogenomics`
- NAS: `nas`
- LAN: `192.168.5.0/24`
- OpenVPN subnet: `192.168.6.0/24`

## Goals

- build practical NetOps, sysadmin, and self-hosting skills
- improve reliability and recovery workflows
- document troubleshooting and decisions clearly
- maintain a public portfolio of real homelab work

## Why This Repo Exists

This repo serves two purposes:
1. personal infrastructure documentation for operating and maintaining the lab
2. a public showcase of practical networking, systems administration, and troubleshooting work

## Notes

All public documentation is sanitized. Sensitive information such as credentials, private keys, tokens, and other secrets is excluded from this repository.
